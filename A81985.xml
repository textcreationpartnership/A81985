         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Every thing ſhould be to us as it is to God.

I ought (therefore) to love truth as I love Heaven, and to fear lying, as I fear Hell.</p>

            <p>Queſtion 29. <hi>What particular caſes be there wherein men are more tempted to, and therefore ought to be more watchfull againſt this ſin of lying?</hi>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In foure caſes eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in caſe of profit. Hence it is that people doe ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily lye in the Market, and in trading, to wit, for the getting of a penny, and ſome worldly pelf. This lying was <hi>Gehazi's</hi> ſin, and a leproſie was his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.22 25, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in caſe of credit. Hence comes ſo much lying in houſes, becauſe people having done amiſſe, are loath to be known of it, leſt they ſhould be put to ſhame by it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deny it ſtoutly, when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170291:32"/>God is able to ſay to them as to <hi>Sarah</hi> (who failed in the like caſe) <hi>Nay but thou didſt</hi> doe ſuch a thing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in caſe of ſafety, and when ſom danger of ſmart is like to enſue by telling the truth. Hence Children lie ſo often to avoid the rod; yea Gods Children alſo, doe to their ſhame and grief, faile in this particular, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Peter, Gen.</hi> 20.2.11.9, 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.70, 75. But if holy parents whip a lying Child twice, one for his fault, and again for his lie: How much more will a holy God of truth puniſh ſuch a fault, yea in his owne Children, yea in them moſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in caſe of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; entertainment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men profeſſe more love then

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yes, there are two of them, the oppoſing of Gods truth, and the perſecuting of Gods Saints.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe the Devil is a liar, that is one in whom there is no truth, and who is ſtill ſetting a foot ſome lye or other againſt the truth; and becauſe he that oppoſes and perverts the right wayes of the Lord, is a Child of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.10.

            <p n="3">3 Cleaving or ſticking to the Chriſtian faith; for faith is a hand that holds every thing faſt, and though many men may ſeem to believe, yet he is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170291:43"/>not a Diſciple (nor a believer) indeed, that doth not continue in the word of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 30.31.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Though they may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be believers, and Chriſtians, in whom the three former things are, yet that our faith may be a ſaving faith, we muſt apply the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and Jeſus Chriſt (who is the ſum of it) unto our own ſoules, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 60 <hi>What help is there for this applying of Chriſt to our owne ſoules?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 It is needfull that we ſee and feele our miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of Chriſt, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the corruption that bears ſway within us, and of the condemnation that is due
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170291:44"/>unto us, and (if a Remedy be not provided) remains for us, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We muſt hearken unto God preaching Jeſus Chriſt unto us, as our onely and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall remedy, with a gracious offer and aſſurance of eaſe by him, if we (feeling our need of him) come unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170291:44"/>to receive him upon his own tearms, is that ſaving applying of him, whereof the queſtion here is made.</p>

            <p n="4">4 To cleave to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith conſtantly, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. And this puts a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Hypocrites, who declare themſelves to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſhew onely, not in deed, becauſe they continue not in Gods word, <hi>John</hi> 8.31.</p>

            <p n="1">1 That the work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be remembred, and whereby the true God (who is known ſo to be by the making of Heaven and Earth in ſix dayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.11, 12.) might be acknowledged and advanced.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the publick worſhip of God might be ſetledly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, uniformly, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently performed by the whole Church of God, and ſo Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf upheld and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for duties are preſerved by dayes and times: Now that the ſervice of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſetledly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there muſt be a ſet day that it may be performed ſolemnly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170291:59"/>and uniformly, there muſt be one and the ſame ſet day that it may be peformed conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that ſet and ſtanding day muſt ſtill return in a due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from all which will ariſe firm reaſon for a weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Sabbath was made form an, that is, that the ſouls of men might be ſuſtained and built up unto ſalvation, by a ſweet and free fellowſhip with God, that whole day in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinances and the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Religion, not without a gracious reſpect alſo to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily refreſhing and neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe ends of the Sabbath being no ceremoniall things, but matters of ſubſtance abiding in their ſtrength throughout all ages; therefore the Sabbath if ſo (founded
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170291:60"/>upon them) is a thing morall and perpetuall.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 100 <hi>By this it appeares that a Sabbath, that is, a day of holy reſt in every week, is a thing not changed, yea is unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhew me now how the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular day comes to be altered, ſo as that Saturday was the Jewes Sabbath, and the Lords day ours?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> One day every week is to be obſerved, that the work of Creation (accompliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of a week) may be remembred; but the day is now altered from the laſt to the firſt day of the week, that the remembrance of that far greater work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, may be preferred, which redemption being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170291:60"/>in Chriſts reſurrection, the day of the reſurrection, is now become the Lords day, that is, the Lords Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 101. <hi>What Rules are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 Remember the Sabbath ſo as to be carefull of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it; that is, ſet thy buſineſſe in order the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and thy heart in order (at leaſt) the morning of the Sabbath, and have not twenty things in thy houſe to be ſet in order on the morning of the Sabbath, when thou ſhouldeſt be ſetting thy heart in order, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Attend carefully the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice, leſt while thou art
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170291:61"/>buſie here and there about vain and impertinent things and thoughts, many precious paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Sermon, or of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, paſſe away without any notice, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.40. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſecrate the day pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and wholly unto God, for it is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; thy heart thy tongue, thy carriage that day muſt not be for thy ſelf, but for thy God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 102. <hi>What helps are there for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath in this holy manner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 Look to thy heart, leſt that rove and be divided from God with every dayes thoughts, and be thou in the Spirit, that is, rapt up and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170291:61"/>with ſpirituall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Look to thy company and conference; for as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work is forbidden becauſe it hinders a ſpirituall work, ſo by the ſame reaſon are worldly words forbidden, becauſe they hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r ſpirituall words, that is, ſuch as are for God and thy ſoules good, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. Our words that day muſt not be our (owne) that is, ſuch as we have mind unto, but ſuch as are meet for the Lords day.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Look to thy works and carriage; this is not a day for the ſhambles, the ſhop, the warehouſe, the workhouſe, but for thee and other good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be upon the Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> that is, being lifted up
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170291:62"/>above the world, to be wholly buſied in Religious exerciſes, and Ordinances wherein Jeſus Chriſt the King of the Church is to be ſeen in his beauty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Look to thy Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, uſing friends (if on the Sabbath day they be with thee) friendly, and rejoycing with them in the Lord, in the ſober uſe of the Creatures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. But appoint not ſolemn Feaſts upon that day, (that's to make the Lords day thy friends day) and take heed leſt by unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary care for many things, thou keep <hi>Mary</hi> from Chriſts feet, that is, thy well-affected Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from a Sermon, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10.41.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Watch thy ſelf in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, let not ſleep, or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170291:62"/>meat, or pleaſant talk, or ſport, take away the time, or thy heart from the Lord of that day, and the end for which he appointed it. They that live in pleaſure on a Sabbath day, are dead while they live, to wit, in regard of their deadnes and indiſpoſition to heavenly things, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14.21.34. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. &amp; 13.6.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 103. <hi>By this is appears that the Sabbath is the principall time, but are there not other times alſo, and that in the week dayes, wherein Chriſtian duties are to be exerciſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yes, a due reſpect is to be had unto Chriſtian duties, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and charity all the week long; for we ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians, and therefore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170291:63"/>to fear God, and give Alms, and pray to God (not this or that day, but) alwayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. In particular, a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had to hearing, reading, conferring, praying at all times.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 104. <hi>What reaſon is there of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word continually?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe Miniſters are to preach in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, Sabbath day, and week dayes, therefore people are to hear: So likewiſe, think not others too careleſſe, that leave ſome other buſineſſes to be at Chriſts feet (ſincerely) but thy ſelf (rather) to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full who art from thence (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily.) <hi>Luke</hi> 10.39, 40.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 105. <hi>What Rule may be given
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170291:63"/>them who have many buſineſſes, for their better guiding and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as concerning the ſix dayes Sermons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The direction uſefull for ſuch may be comprehended under theſe three heads.</p>
            <p>The Judgement muſt be well informed.</p>
            <p>The Conſcience well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>And the Providence of God well obſerved.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 106. <hi>How is the Judgement to be informed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Both generally and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of the generality, that a man muſt by no means make l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ght of ſpirituall opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but redeem them rather,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170291:64"/>and purchaſe them with abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of outward things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For particular opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, a light may be given for our direction by a two-fold conſideration, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Of the ſtate of Times: Time for good exerciſes is ſtill to be redeemed, but ſpecially when the times are evill, that is, the more corrupt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, the more doubtfull and dangerous the times are, the more earneſt we ſhould be to wait out and to make uſe of all ſpirituall opportunities, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28, 30. <hi>John</hi> 12.35, 36.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Of the nature of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when Chriſt goes by when there is a more ſpeciall occaſion, a Miniſter that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with Authority, and not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170291:64"/>as the <hi>Scribes,</hi> then (without the contempt of the loweſt means and Miniſter, but with a greater deſire of this greateſt means) get up into a Tree as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, and lay all other ordinary things aſide, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, to enjoy God in a more ſpeciall manner, the reaſon is, becauſe ordinary duties muſt yield to extraordinary, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary workes of piety are to yield to extraordinary works of mercy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the neceſſary exigence of our calling, to extraordinary works of piety <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7, 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Of our own ſtate and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, which muſt make Chriſtians to ſtraine above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, in three caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 At their firſt converſion, the new converted Chriſtians were every day in the Temple,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170291:65"/>and new born Babes had need be oft at the breaſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42.46. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the time of affliction and tentation, as people ſpare time for their buſineſſe, to goe to the Phyſitian, &amp; are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 17. <hi>Job</hi> 33.23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When in the courſe of the Miniſtry, ſome ſpecial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in hand, that more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their ſtate, and is more fit for their preſent uſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.6.24. Shall not <hi>Cornelius</hi> leave all to wait upon <hi>Peter,</hi> for that information which he ſo much needed?</p>
            <p n="4">4 Of the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, about whom there are two Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Be amiable, and make thy zeale as little offenſive to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170291:65"/>as may be.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Judge not ſeverely of others that be not come ſo far, that are not ſo forward after ſpirituall opportunities, as thou art, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 107. <hi>How is the conſcience to be examined for the direction in this point?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Conſcience is to be lookt unto two wayes</p>
            <p n="1">1 If thou omit an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, watch thy conſcience ſo well, as that whilſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt an Ox, a Farm, a Wiſe neceſſarily hinders thee, God (that knowes thy heart) may not come and ſay, that the true cauſe of thy abſence is, becauſe thou makeſt light of a Sermon, or elſe ſuch things would not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170291:66"/>have hindred; or that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy unbelief, as if God would look to nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him, while thou takeſt an opportunity for him: be able to ſay (if there be an abſence) that the Sermon was (indeed) eſteemed, only thy calling (not thy coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or unbelief) hindred.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If thou take an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at a hard hand, (when thoſe that be good will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps queſtion it, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.40.) be able to ſay it is not becauſe thou loveſt not thy buſineſſe, and ſo art willing to cloke idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with profeſſion; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt a luſt to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or in company, to ſhew thy ſelf, or for the loaves, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. or to maintain a credit among profeſſours, or out of an itching humor to divers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170291:66"/>Preachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. and to ſee which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter makes the beſt Muſick, but becauſe thy conſcience (upon the beſt conſideration) is convicted of the neceſſity of that duty at that time.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 108. <hi>What direction is to be taken from the providence of God in this particular?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If God croſſe thee when ſpirituall opportunities are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in thoſe outward things that cauſed the omiſſion, or if God proſper thee in outward things, when thou ſtraineſt thy ſelf to be about better things, learn by the dealing of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, to leave the world (at fit times) for thy ſoules good, for ſuch acts of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are Gods notices, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170291:67"/>give a light to tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in doubtfull caſes.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 109. <hi>What Reaſon is there of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture continually, as well as on the Sabbath day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe it is a bleſſed thing to read Scripture, and becauſe the time is at hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. that is, no man knowes how near the time is, when by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſions and afflictions he ſhall be put to make ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe of Scripture; now it's good to read that at every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that is neceſſary to make our condition bleſſed, when we ſhall be brought to extremity.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Pretend not in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou and thy Family are over-weary; for wouldeſt thou have thy weary Servant provide thy ſupper, and thou
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170291:70"/>thy ſelfe not ſerve God with him by Prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.7, 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Redeem a time. Gain it from thy work and worldly buſineſſe, or from thy ſleep, riſe the earlier that thou and thy family may pray together in the morning <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35. work the harder that (buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being diſpatcht) thou and thy Family may have a time to read and to pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the evening.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 116. <hi>What Help or Motive is there for the eſtabliſhing of a courſe of prayer in private Families, notwithſtanding all worldly buſineſſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There are theſe two helps.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Have ſerious thoughts of God. (Take) a time to hear and pray, for God can tell very
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170291:71"/>well what time thou haſt, yea (make) a time, diſpatch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe out of the way, for God can tell very well what time thou (mayeſt) have, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be thy worldly buſines that hinders thee, or an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable lothneſſe to be about any ſpirituall buſineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Have reverend thoughts of prayer. Men have baſe and Atheiſticall thoughts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerciſes, to wit, that ſo much time is loſt in them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good at all to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them. Hence it is that they are ſo willing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looſe a prayer then a penny; but look upon prayer as a familiar communing with the moſt glorious God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>laſt.</hi> as the ſupplyer of all our wants, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9, 10. as a ſhelter from all danger, <hi>Ezra</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:170291:71"/>8.21, 22. as the ſetler, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, proſperer of all buſineſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.12.15.27. I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thus of it, and neglect it if thou canſt. Worthy thoughts of better things, will deviſe wayes to enjoy them, but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity abandons duty, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.4.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 117. <hi>Is not a ſpeciall time alſo to be taken (as there ſhall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) for ſpeciall and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary exerciſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> By all means, come to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and humiliation from any work, from any content, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. Be more willing to looſe a day, than a duty, then ſuch a duty, although a day is no more loſt in ſuch a ſervice, than that day is loſt that a man ſpares to get a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170291:72"/>thouſand pound debt ſtruck out, or to get a pardon for his life. Such godlineſſe is great gaine.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 118. <hi>Hitherto of the applying of Gods word unto the duties of our generall calling, ſhew me now what directions we may have from it as concerning our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Concerning that, the word of God directs us three wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It ſhewes that every man muſt have a Calling.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It guides a man for the chooſing of his Calling.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It teaches him how to behave himſelf in it.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 119. <hi>How doth it appear that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is to have ſome calling or other?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170291:72"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond, the two only innocent men that ever lived upon the earth, had both of them a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Adam</hi> dreſt the Garden, and Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.</p>
            <p>And that all men generally ought to have a Calling, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We be Chriſtians, and therefore muſt not live diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10, 12. but abide in a Calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We be Servants, and therefore muſt not live idlely and licentiouſly, that Chriſt our Maſter ſhould find us ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or drinking, (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.3, 6, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. end—) but waiting and working, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and (ſo) doing, as belongs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170291:73"/>to us in our places, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.36.43.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We be Stewards, and therefore muſt not live care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, or improvidently, for we muſt give an account of our ſtewardſhip. Talents we have to Trade withall, and from them (yea, if we have but one of them) advantage is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Neither will our Maſter be content to receive his own again, but he muſt receive his own with uſury, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.27.</p>
            <p>And in ill caſe are idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (whether Beggars or Gentlemen,) yea, in a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, becauſe God wil take (not onely the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but) the unprofitable Servant, and caſt him into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er darkneſſe, and that moſt juſtly, nothing being more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, than that a man
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170291:73"/>ſhould be a Servant (and that of God himſelf) and doe no work.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 120. <hi>How may a man judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture, what Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make choiſe of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> A man may judge of that two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By his own gifts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For we ſhall ſtill find in Scripture that God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe or made men fit for thoſe employments to which he called them. <hi>David</hi> that was to be a victorious King, had courage and might, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.26.32. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that was to be a glorious King, had wiſdome and a large heart. <hi>Jehu</hi> was (apparently) a man fit to be what God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to be, a through Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170291:74"/>2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.20. and <hi>Timothy</hi> was (in ſight) a man fit to make a Miniſter of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By Gods calling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, to wit, by ordinary lawfull means, and the motions and deſires of men in the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety wherein we live, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of our gifts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly take order to diſpoſe of us, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.6. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 121. <hi>May not a man in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes change his Calling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> A man may change his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in three caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If there be a miſtake, and a man by his owne error, or others over-ruling, be fallen upon a Calling unſuitable to his gifts, and croſſe to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170291:74"/>inclination.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this, is becauſe all outward calls muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the inward. Mans call muſt be corrected by Gods call, and a mans employments ſhould be (ſooner or later) ſutable to his Talent and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Though a man be apt for the Calling wherein he is, yet if he be able alſo for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he may (for the publick good) change a meaner for a more excellent Calling.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When a mans Calling cannot maintain himſelfe and his family, he is inforced to change it (for ſome other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit able Calling which he is able to manage) out of reſpect to his own neceſſity.</p>
            <p>But for a man to change his Calling for another below his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170291:75"/>gifts, becauſe he loves his eaſe and profit:</p>
            <p>Or for another that is above his gifts, becauſe he deſires a greater gaine, and affects an eſtimation above his worth, this is unlawfull and unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 122. <hi>How muſt a man be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about his Calling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 Providently, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.23. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.23. <hi>Boaz</hi> had one to overſee his ſervants yet he comes to the field to overſee them and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers too, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Diligently, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.23. Lazineſſe is next to idleneſſe, and doing ſluggiſhly to doing nothing; what a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, he ſhould doe it with all his power, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170291:75"/>
               <hi>Geneſis</hi> 31.6.40.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Faithfully, not truſting to our own toiling, as if it were in our owne power to get wealth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.18. but buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Gods bleſſing, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.22.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Moderately, that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Not hindring our ſelves in the exerciſes of Religion, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.39, 40. To be ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as that the ſix dayes will not ſerve, as to have no leiſure for private and family prayer, to have ſo much to doe with the world as to ſhut out God, that he can ſay nothing to us, nor we to him, this is to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, and to labour after the food that periſheth, <hi>John</hi> 6.27.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not wearing away our bodies with exceſſive toyle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.18.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:170291:76"/>3 Avoiding exceſſive care, which diſturbs and annoyes the heart, and ſo hinders that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe of mind that there ought to be in duties of piety, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. and that peaceableneſſe of carriage that there ought to be with thoſe that are of our company, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.17.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Holily, not with a (will) to be rich, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. but to be employed for Gods glory, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. and for providing for thoſe that God hath given us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. as alſo that we may have to give to him that needeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 123. <hi>Are men ſo to be buſied in their Callings, as that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation is allowed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Recreation, that is, reſting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170291:76"/>after a man is toiled out with labour, and fetching a mans breath (as it were) <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is refreſhing and ſetting an edge upon a mans ſpirit, by ſome pleaſant and harmleſſe exerciſe, to be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it furthers a man in his Calling, and makes him more profitable then otherwiſe he could be.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 124. <hi>Since by how much Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more delightfull, by ſo much Rules are more needfull; ſhew me what Rules are to be obſerved, that Recreation may be better ordered?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Our Recreation ſhould be</p>
            <p n="1">1 In and by things lawfull, not vain and vile Books, not filthy or ſlanderous Songs, girding at thoſe that fear God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.12. not fooliſh talking, and (un-Saintlike) jeſting, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.3, 4. not mixt dancing, for <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. we are not to lead our ſelves into tentation.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It is needfull, when the body is wearied, the ſpirits weakned and waſted. Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170291:77"/>is not as meat and drink of ordinary uſe, but as Wine, that is, a little is to be taken of it, when there are evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Such as is needfull. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall exerciſe is a fit Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Students, but to ſit down and employ the mind in reading the Bible, or ſom good Book or other, is the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing for Labourers.</p>
            <p n="4">4 At a fit time. Pleaſurable Recreations are not to be uſed</p>

A working heart is like a going and grinding Mill, if a better grain be not in it, there muſt be a worſe; <hi>Walk in the Spirit,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15.) that is, let grace ever find you work; <hi>and then you ſhall not fullfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> A thoughtfull man ſhall doe well (and without that he ſhall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly doe well) when ever he goes abroad, or muſt be for ſome time alone, to ſet his heart ſome particular and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable task, and to hold it ſtrictly thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He muſt maintain a War
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170291:81"/>with it. That is, he muſt be ever mortifying his naturall and moſt ſpeciall Iuſts; for as the ſeverity of Authority ſo takes away Thieves that men may ride alone without fear, ſo if men be ever calling in queſtion their inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and executions upon them, they may walk alone without hurt, and be ſolitary without ſin.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170291:84"/>the more carefull be thou to doe what thou cameſt about, ſpeedily, and then fly away, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.10.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In regard of our Superiours, two things are eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Prayer for them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Nothing being more needfull then prayer, for thoſe that have ſo great a task, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.9. and that are under ſo great temptation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. nor any thing being more reaſonable, then that they that are common perſons, ſhould be ſupported with a common

            <p n="2">2 Honour and due reſpect toward them, which honour is of ſo large extent, as that it comprehends the whole duty of the fifth Commandement.

A great fault it is even of thoſe that profeſſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to take up reports of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours lightly, and thereupon to ſpeak their pleaſure; when we ought not to ſpeak evill of dignities, <hi>Jude</hi> 1.8. when ſuch evil ſpeaking is much obſerved by Oppoſites, and laid to the charge of profeſſors, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.4. and they know not well how to anſwer it, becauſe they muſt needs yield, that they ought not to ſpeak evill of the Ruler of the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When they doe well and worthily, fear them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a high eſtimation of them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>

            <p>Queſtion 145. <hi>Since you ſpeak of faſhions, tell me what is to be thought concerning new faſhions in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 To ſpeak generally, all affectation and offence in the form and faſhion of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell is to be avoided; that is, we muſt not apparell our ſelves ſo as to ſhew we have a mind to be in the faſhion; nor ſo, as to encourage thoſe that be vainer, and grieve the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter party, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Such faſhions of Apparel as clearly and at firſt ſight croſſe the Rules of Chriſtian modeſty (as the attire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whereby nakedneſſe is in part covered, but in a great
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170291:95"/>part diſcovered) are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as abominable. It's ſtrange that honeſt women will not give Harlots leave to have ſuch an Attire as may be properly called the Attire of an Harlot (<hi>Prov.</hi> 7.10.) to wit, as unbeſeeming the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of a ſober woman.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Other faſhions there be tolerable rather then laudable; and that they may be tolerable it belongs to the wiſedom and ſobriety of Chriſtians to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe two Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Not to enter into them ſuddenly, ſo as to keep even pace with the moſt forward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioniſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not to uſe them exactly, and in the utmoſt extremity.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe argues levity, the later curioſity and want of worth, both pride and vanity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170291:95"/>3 Any faſhion uſed out of pride and vanity of mind is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſinfull.</p>
            <p>Onely for ſome better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſome more liberty may be given and taken, <hi>viz.</hi> in theſe regards.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To avoid the imputation and offence of fingularity, and that it may appear that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians doe not affect to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightly, nor put the ſtreſſe of Religion upon theſe leſſen things.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In caſe of duty both of Children to parents, and of wives to husbands, whom the clearneſſe of the duty to give content, makes theſe things more diſputable, and gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for diſpenſing with them, at leaſt in ſome degrees.</p>
            <p>But there's a wide difference between theſe two, to wit, when
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170291:96"/>ſuch or ſuch are in the faſhion out of a mind and affectation, and when their appearing in the faſhion (enforced by the imperiouſneſſe of vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and ungodly Superiours) in their trouble and affliction.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 146. <hi>But is not Apparell an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing, why then ſhould there be ſo much ſcruple about it?</hi>

            <p n="1">1 It's true that the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling of our ſelves this or that way, is a thing indifferent in the generality; but pride, lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, vanity of mind are not things indifferent, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſinfull, and ſo are thoſe particular faſhions that ſpring from and manifeſtly ſavour of theſe corrupt roots.</p>

            <p n="3">3 I Anſwer, with a Holy Father in a like caſe, <hi>That's the very worke of the Devill to make indifferent things to be contemned.</hi> The Devil is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much a gainer by that which is apparently ſinfull, as by things of an indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for therein men ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p n="2">2 Be humble. For as we are greater then the greateſt of all Gods Judgements in regard of the merit of our ſins (<hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13.) ſo we are leſſe then the leaſt of all Gods mercies, in regard of the unworthineſſe of our perſons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.</p>

               <p n="2">2 In that way we muſt walk, without turning either to the left hand by prophaneſſe, or to the right hand by ſuperſtition, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32, 33.</p>

                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:170291:163"/>3 That we may ſo doe, we muſt continually take heed to our wayes, according to the word of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9.) and (withall) pray earneſtly that we may not wander, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. but may hear a voyce behind us, ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walke in it,</hi> Iſa. 30.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4 We muſt turn into this way as ſoon as we can, and be (timely) good, that we may be (greatly) good, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.3.12. and when we be once come in, we muſt never goe out, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The ſpeciall time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of coming in, is when God ſends Miniſters to make known his word unto us. The ſending forth of a faithfull Miniſtry, is a not ſuffering of us to walk in our own wayes (<hi>Acts</hi> 14.16.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170291:163"/>&amp; 17.30.) if therefore thou walkeſt in them (afterward) thou doeſt it whether God will or no, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. and ſhalt accordingly ſuffer for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.26.</p>
               <p n="6">6 In this narrow way there muſt be a continuall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and going forward, the path of the juſt being not as the morning cloud that vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth at the firſt heat (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4.) but as the morning light that ſhines more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perfect day, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The paths of wiſedome are (indeed) paths of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17.) and the longer we walk in this way the eaſier we ſhall find it (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.29.) it being made eaſie to us, both by grace, enabling us to walk acceptably (<hi>Ezek.</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:170291:164"/>36.27.) and by faith flying to Chriſt, becauſe we cannot walk perfectly (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4.) and by uſe, whereby the yoak (more cumberſome at firſt) comes to be born more quietly and contentedly at laſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29, 30.) it will be our eaſe (therefore) if we make it our exerciſe, to keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God and man, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="8">8 This is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad men, that the one comfort themſelves with their ſtate and condition (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.19.) the other with their way and carriage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.3.</p>
               <p n="9">9 However Gods way be every where ſpoken againſt, yet the ſingular comfort of it is felt by faith all the while we walk in it, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30 (and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170291:164"/>then moſt when we have leaſt of all outward comforts, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.21. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. <hi>Job</hi> 13.15, 16. &amp; 27.5, 6.) but then ſhall this comfort be perfectly felt, and perpetually enjoyed when we come to our journeys end, and even to that glory, honour, immortality, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, which they ſhall be poſſeſſed of who patiently continue in well-doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7.</p>

            <p n="1">1 SEt in order thy affaires the day before the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and thy affections in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the morning of the Sabbath; the former prevents (upon the Lords day) worldly works, and the later diſtracting thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:170291:166"/>2 The heart being purged and prepared, there ariſes from thence a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sabbath and weekly ſervices. He that hears a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the week day, leaves the world, but upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a man takes leave of the world, that is, he ſequeſters himſelf even wholly from it, and by meditation and prayer fills his heart with contrary, that is, with heavenly things; hence while he hears the word hee's much more affected with it, becauſe the heart is clear from the world, and carried heaven, and finds (after) a greater effect of it, as fruit is much more and better in well prepared ground.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The principall duty of the Lords day, is repairing to the Lords houſe, to the Aſſembly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170291:166"/>and Ordinances of God morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.7.11.) there being therein</p>
            <p n="1">1 A publick profeſſion, that we are the people of the Lord Jeſus, while we leave all things, one day in ſeaven, that we may attend him; and</p>
            <p n="2">2 A filling of our Cyſtern from God the Fountain (that is) a repleniſhing of our heads and hearts with thoſe heavenly things whereby we ſhall be furniſhed and ſupplyed for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time, and in ſpeciall, all the week after, for a holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the narrow way, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule of hearing being to hear for afterward, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.23.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But as the day is not, ſo neither are the duties thereof ended, when the publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is diſſolved, but in private
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170291:167"/>alſo, it is meet that we ſhould be mindfull of</p>

Upon the Lords day we ſhould be in the Spirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. in a ſpirituall temper, poſſeſſed and taken up with ſpirituall thoughts, that the ſpeeches and actions proceeding from us that day may be in a ſpeciall degree the breathings &amp; Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſtian and ghoſtly communications, tending to the ſpirituall advantage of our ſelves and thoſe with whom we converſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.11.

            <p n="5">5 Much adoe there is about a Sabbath day, and Sabbath duties, and they that account fellowſhip with God a heavy burden, are glad they have this to ſay, that learned men differ; that ſo they may better take leave to doe what they liſt, and be far from God, without the condemnation of men; but they that love that life that we ſhall lead in heaven, will be glad to live with God one day in a week here (at leaſt in ſome degree) as they look to live with him every day hereafter.</p>

            <p n="2">2 If there be much buſines, let not prayer be omitted, that the buſineſſe may be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (that is, as if a man having a long journey to goe, ſhould haſten out a foot, and not ſtay to make ready his Horſe, for it is God that muſt carry us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in all our buſineſſes) but riſe the ſooner, that the duty of prayer may firſt be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather out of ſleep, then put off prayer, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35. for all proſperity comes from this, <hi>I am with thee,</hi> Gen. 39.5.

            <p n="4">4 Let Family exerciſes be performed, either the firſt time thou canſt take, or the fitteſt time thou canſt chooſe.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Thy works and occaſions
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170291:169"/>being ſuch as thou art called to. Be about them 1 diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; a good Chriſtian ſhould not be a bad husband (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. 2 Juſtly and conſcionably; A good husband ſhould not be a bad Chriſtian, nor any way defraud or over-reach his brother, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. 3 Diſcreetly, for he that handleth a matter wiſely ſhall find good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. 4 Faithfully, and with a dependance upon God, notwithſtanding all thy wit and care; for he that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Lord happy is he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When thou art alone, hate vaine thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.113. when thou art in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny let thy communication be ſuch as if Jeſus Chriſt were at thy heels ready to overtake

Generally, be ſuch in company as that thou maiſt with comfort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy carriage when thou art alone; and ſuch alone as that thou mayeſt with credit declare thy carriage when thou art in company.</p>
